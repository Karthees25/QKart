Automated Testing Enhancement for QKart E-Commerce Platform
Project Overview: Testing QKart E-Commerce Platform



The QKart project aimed to thoroughly test an e-commerce website, QKart, catering to online retail needs. As part of this project, the Application Under Test (AUT) comprised a comprehensive stack, including a database (DB), an API layer, and a User Interface (UI).



Domain Focus:The project focused specifically on the online retail and e-commerce domain, ensuring that the website met the standards expected in this industry.



Testing Objectives: Testing was crucial to ensure the functionality, usability, and reliability of the QKart website, catering to customer needs effectively.



Types of Tests: Various types of tests were employed, including functional testing to assess features, UI testing for user interaction, sanity testing for initial checks, regression testing to maintain quality over time, and performance testing to gauge website responsiveness.



Tech Stack: The tech stack used Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, Java for coding test scripts, and TestNG as the testing framework. These tools were chosen for their compatibility and familiarity with the team.



Solution Approach: The team analyzed requirements meticulously, designing test cases to cover diverse scenarios. Automated test scripts were then developed using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG, ensuring efficient and thorough testing.



Alternative Approaches: While exploring alternative approaches such as Cypress and Cucumber, the team ultimately opted for Selenium and TestNG due to their suitability and alignment with project goals.



Challenges and Solutions: Challenges encountered included handling dynamic elements, synchronizing test execution with application responses, and managing test data. These challenges were overcome through strategies such as explicit waits, data-driven testing, and robust error handling mechanisms.



Code Structure:The project followed the page object model, with dedicated areas for defining each page and its associated actions. This structure enhanced code management, minimized duplication, and improved reusability. Test methods were annotated using @Test, and Selenium WebDriver was utilized for interaction with web elements, ensuring comprehensive test coverage across different scenarios.



Conclusion:

The QKart testing project exemplified a meticulous approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of an e-commerce platform. Through careful planning, effective utilization of tools and methodologies, and diligent testing efforts, the project contributed to delivering a seamless online shopping experience for customers.
